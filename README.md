# Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparmater tuning is the technique for choosing appropriate/optimal hyperparameter  in a machine learning algorithms. Hyperparamters can be considerered as parameters that are predefined for machine learning algorithms, hyperparameters provides more control on how the machine will learn.

Other parameters are learnable parameters as these parameteres are learned while training occuring.

Hyperparameter Tuning is an important task in machine learning and Deep learning based methods, as the models performance largely depends on appropriate hyperparameters.
